# Disease-prediction  ![A Project by ](http://learncodeonline.in/gitone.png "Made By") - ## Saksham Jain
In this project, I have used the data as shown in Fig-1 to predict Disease by some symptons using Machine Learning Approach.


Firstly pre-processings of the input data is done, code in "dataset_making.ipynb", To convert Raw_data.xlsx into Dataset.csv 

-> Using Support Vector Machines - Results are promissing with an accuracy of almost 90%.
